<p>If the Viewer does not show up in the Toolbox, this could be for several reasons.</p>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure you are indeed working on a Visual C# Windows Forms Project. The easiest way to check this is by looking in the Solution Explorer. If you do not have a C# icon next to your project and a Form1.cs in your list of classes, close the project and create a new one. This time, make sure it's a Visual C# Windows Forms Project.</li>
	<li>See if you have a Viewer.cs file in the Solution Explorer. If it's not there, the <code>Imint.Vidview.Sample.UserControl</code> package has not been successfully installed. Go back to the NuGet Package Manager and install it.</li>
	<li>If Viewer.cs has successfully compiled, try double clicking it. This brings up the Windows Forms Designer for Viewer.cs. You should see an empty, gray area. If you are instead seeing a list of error messages, make sure your NuGet packages are up to date.</li>
	<li>If Viewer.cs is in the Solution Explorer, it should have a User Control icon next to it. If not, it has failed to build. In that case, right-click Viewer.cs and select "Properties" the bottom of the list. Make sure that its "Build Action" is set to "Compile".

	<li>If the Viewer still isn't showing up in the Toolbox, try creating a new UserControl and see if it too fails to show up in the list. If so, go to Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Windows Forms Designer -&gt; ToolBox -&gt; Automatically Populate Toolbox and make sure it's set to True. Rebuild and try again.
