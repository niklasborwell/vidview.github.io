<header>Vidview SDK TCP Getting Started Guide</header>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Vidview Window is a video viewer application that can use Vidhance video 
enhancement. Although Vidview Window is a standalone application it is indented to be 
controlled from another application over TCP/IP. Vidview Window will play video either
available on disk, from capture devices or received over the network.</p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>Vidview requires Windows 7, .NET 4.0 and a GPU from NVidia, ATI/AMD or an Intel HD Graphics 3000 or better.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<!--<p>When upgrading, please uninstall any old versions of Vidview. Download the latest installer from
<a href="https://aurora.imint.se/download/Vidview/rcv/2.7/Imint.Vidview.Rcv_2.7.0-rc2.msi">our server</a>. You should have received a user name and password from us.
Run the installer and when prompted select typical installation if you don't have received any other instructions.</p>-->
<!--<p>Download the latest version from <a href="https://aurora.imint.se/download/vidview/2.8/vidview_2.8.0.4009b.zip">our server</a> and unzip it. You should have received a user name and password from us.</p>-->
<p>The installation process is described in the <a href="http://vidview.imint.se/installation/Vidview SDK Demo Installation Guide.html">Vidview SDK Demo Installation Guide.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Requesting a License</h2>
<p>In order to use Vidhance video enhancements and/or extra video codecs you need to request a license for the computer you run on. The easiest way to activate is to connect your computer to the Internet and then start Vidview Window with the following commandline: <code>Imint.Vidview.Window.exe -s "license.request 01234ABCDabcd"</code> where <code>01234ABCDabcd</code> is replaced with your license key.</p>

<h2>Telnet Client</h2>
<p>During the integration process you will need a telnet client. If you don't have 
any other preferences we recommend using 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/download.html">Putty</a> 
but the one bundled with Windows will also do the job.</p>
<!--
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>You will also need a video to look at. Please download <a href="https://aurora.imint.se/download/Vidview/mission/Mansion.zip">this</a> file, unzip it and place its contents in a folder named <code>Vidview</code> in your <code>Documents</code> folder.</p>
-->

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<ol>
<li>Start Vidview Window with the argument <code>Imint.Vidview.Window.exe -r telnet://:23</code>.</li>
<li>Use your telnet client to connect to localhost port 23.</li>
<li>When connected you will see a prompt: <code># &gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Type: <code>media.open file:///c:/users/user+name/documents/video.avi</code> and press enter. (Path will depend on operating system and user name.)</li>
<li>Type: <code>media.play</code> and press enter.</li>
<li>Now the video should play.</li>
</ol>

<h1>The Remote Interface</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The remote interface comes in two flavors:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>tcp</dt><dd>A raw interface suitable for usage by software.</dd>
<dt>telnet</dt><dd>A more user friendly interface that supports editing 
(backspace, delete, left and right arrow), history of previous commands 
(up and down arrow), auto completion (tab) and help (tab pressed twice)</dd>	
</dl>

<h2>Activating</h2>
<p>The server is activated by passing <code>-r [protocol]://[address]:[port]</code> as an argument at the
command line when starting Vidview.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>protocol</code></dt><dd>The protocol the server should speak, either <code>tcp</code> or <code>telnet</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>address</code></dt><dd>The ip-address the server should bind to. Leave out in order to bind to all interfaces.</dd>
<dt><code>port</code></dt> <dd>The port at which the server should listen to connections.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Examples: <code>Imint.Vidview.Window.exe -r telnet://:23</code>,<br> <code>Imint.Vidview.Window.exe -r tcp://localhost:1337</code>.<br> The number of concurrent connections is unlimited. Every connection will get its own replies and notifications.</p>

<p>Vidview can listen to multiple ports by adding several arguments: <code>Imint.Vidview.Window.exe -r telnet://:23 -r tcp://localhost:1337</code>. This way your application may use the raw tcp connection and you may during development use the more convenient telnet interface.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Paths</h3>
<p>The remote interface is structured using three classes of items: </p>
<dl>
<dt>properties</dt><dd>Properties are used to contain a single value.</dd>
<dt>methods</dt><dd>Methods are used make something happen.</dd>
<dt>objects</dt><dd>Objects are used to group items together. They may contain properties, methods and other objects.</dd>
</dl>
<p></p>
<p>Objects, properties and methods are qualified by paths. A path starting with a single
dot is always an absolute path. Paths not starting with a dot are relative to the current
working object. It is possible to change the current working object in the object hierarchy
by sending the path to the desired object. The path to the current working object is
indicated in the prompt. Sending a <code>..</code> the current working object is changed one step
higher up the hierarchy. Starting a path with <code>.</code> will make it absolute. Sending a line with only <code>.</code> will change the current working object to the topmost one.</p>

<h3>Response Types</h3>
<p>All responses begin on a new line. The first letter of the line qualifies the response type.
The second letter is always a whitespace. There four response types are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>prompt</dt><dd>The prompt response is followed by the current working object path and ends
with <code>&gt;</code>. Example: <code># media&gt;</code>.</dd>
<dt>value</dt><dd>The value response is the result of getting or setting a property. Example: <code>$ media.position 00:00:00</code></dd>
<dt>notification</dt><dd>The notification response is generated when a property, for which notifications are activated, is changed. Example: <code>% media.position 00:00:00</code></dd>
<dt>error</dt><dd>The error response signals that the operation failed. Example: <code>! media.open</code></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Getting a Property</h3>
<p>To get the value of a property send its path without any additional argument. The answer
will be in the form of a value response.<br>
Example command: <code>media.position</code>, response: <code>$ media.position 00:00:00</code></p>

<h3>Setting a Property</h3>
<p>To set the value of a property send its path with the value as argument. It will return a value response.<br>
Example command: <code>media.position 00:00:00</code>, response: <code>$ media.position 00:00:00</code>.
</p>

<h3>Activating Notifications for a Property</h3>
<p>To get notifications of changes to a property just type the full name
 of the property at the prompt followed by a space and the string <code>notify</code> and press enter.<br>
Example command: <br><code>media.position notify</code>,<br> response: <br><code>$ media.position 00:00:00</code><br> and on changes a notification like this <br><code>! media.position 00:00:01</code>will arrive.</p>

<h3>Invoking Methods</h3>
<p>Methods may require one or more arguments. Arguments are separated 
from each other using a space character. When a value contains a space 
characters they shall be prepended with backspace or the value shall be 
surrounded by double quotes.<br>
Example:<br> <code>media.play</code>,<br> <code>media.open file://c:/video.avi</code>.</p>

<h3>The Telnet Interface</h3>
<p>Editing at the command line can be done by using backspace, delete, 
left and right arrow keys. Auto completion is performed using the tab 
button. If more then one auto completion option is available a help is 
shown.</p>

<h3>Reference Manual</h3>
<p>To get a complete reference of all available properties, methods and objects invoke the <code>help</code> method at the root level. It will generate a reference manual and open it in your browser.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>Some properties you might want to be set every time you start Vidview. In that case you might put them in a text file named <code>settings.conf</code> together with the Vidview installation. In case you want to use different settings for different instances of Vidview you might want to specify a settings file by adding something like <code>-c settings1.conf</code> to the command line.</p>

<h3>The Raw TCP Interface</h3>
<p>When using the raw interface the server does not echo any characters back. Data is encoded using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>. As newline characters a single linefeed (short name: <code>LF</code>, c escape sequence: <code>\n</code>, hexadecimal: <code>0x0a</code>, decimal: <code>10</code>) is used.</p>

<h1>Window Handling</h1>
<p>If you want to run Vidview Window as a viewer that appears to be a part of your applications window you need to add <code>-s window.visible false</code> to your commandline. We recomend that you then dock the window and resize it using Windows API (<code>SetParent</code> and <code>MoveWindow</code> funtions in <code>user32.dll</code>). It is also possible to simply move the window into the right position like this:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>window.position 10, 20</code></dt><dd>Move the upper left corner of the window to screen coordinates 10, 20 in pixels.</dd>
<dt><code>window.size 1000, 800</code></dt><dd>Change the viewers width to 1000 pixels and it's height to 800 pixels.</dd>
<dt><code>window.border none</code></dt><dd>Remove borders from viewer window.</dd>
<dt><code>window.topmost true</code></dt><dd>Make viewer window stay on top.</dd>
<dt><code>window.visible true</code></dt><dd>Make viewer window visible.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whenever your application loses focus it should send <code>window.topmost false</code> and when it regains focus it should send <code>window.topmost true</code>. When your application window moves it should update the viewers position and when the size changes it should update the viewers size.</p>

<p>If your application has multiple windows of which Vidview Window is supposed to be one you might want to not shut down Vidview when the user presses the close icon. Instead you might want to hide Vidview and continue to run it in the background so that the next time the user wants to view the video to additional startup time is needed. This can be accomplished by using this initialization sequence:
<dl>
<dt><code>window.visible notify</code></dt><dd>Turn on notifications on window visibility in case you want to change the status of your user interfaces dependent on if the Vidview Window window is visible.</dd>
<dt><code>window.title "Video 1"</code></dt><dd>Change the title of the Vidview Window window to "Video 1"</dd>
<dt><code>window.closeaction hide</code></dt><dd>Make the window hide instead of closing down the application.</dd>
<dt><code>window.visible true</code></dt><dd>Make viewer window visible.</dd>
</dl>
When you intend to close down your application you need to send:
<dl>
<dt><code>window.visible false</code></dt><dd>Make viewer window hidden.</dd>
<dt><code>close</code></dt><dd>Close the application.</dd>
</dl>
</body></html>
