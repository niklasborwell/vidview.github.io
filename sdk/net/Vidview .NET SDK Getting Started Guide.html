<h1>Preparations</h1>
<p>This section will guide you through installing and setting up the tools and utilities you will need in order to use the Vidview .NET SDK.</p>
 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Imint Vidview is a customizable collection of video viewer applications that can use Imint Vidhance&reg; video enhancements. The Vidview SDK for .NET is an integration toolkit, provided as a Windows Forms control in C# for Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft Windows 7. The Vidview SDK makes it possible to embed smart video viewing in a host application. The SDK is provided as a set of <a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet</a> packages, from which a simple Vidview Window standalone application can quickly be built. This application will play video from disk, from capture devices, and video received over network. This Getting Started Guide aims to provide the information needed to get new users up and running with a basic Vidview Window application.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Visual Studio</h2>
<p>The Vidview SDK is prepared for Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop, under the Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5.50709. Make sure that you have a version of Visual Studio 2012 (or later) installed, and ensure that the installation is updated. If you do not have this installed, you can get a license of Visual Studio Express 2012 from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads">Microsoft.</a></p>
 
<p>Launch Visual Studio, and make sure that its built-in NuGet Package Manager is up to date. If you need help with this step, follow <a href="Updating NuGet.html">these&nbsp;instructions</a> before continuing.</p>

<p><b>Please note</b> that even a brand new installation of Visual Studio is <b>not</b> necessarily up to date.</p>
   
<h2>Imint Vidhance License Key</h2>
<p> If you intend to use functionality from Imint's real-time video enhancement technology, Vidhance, you need to have obtained an appropriate software license key from Imint. If you have not received a license key, please contact Imint. You may also use the license key <code>novidhance</code>, which will be accepted as a valid license, but with no Vidhance functionality enabled.</p>

<h2>Creating a Visual Studio Project</h2>
<p>The following step-by-step instruction aims to guide you through setting up a Visual Studio project for Vidview. The project will build a simple demo application, allowing you to open a video from file and perform basic video control.</p>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Launch Visual Studio. In the "File" menu, select "New Project".</li>
	<li>In the "New Project" dialog, select "Visual C#" templates from the left menu, and select a "Windows Forms Application" as shown below. Give the project a suitable name and location, and press "OK"</li>

<h1>Installing packages</h1>
<h2>NuGet Packages</h2>
The Vidview SDK comes in NuGet packages. NuGet is a package manager that keeps track of dependencies and handles updates. The next few steps will guide you through setting up your own local package feed, containing the Vidview SDK.</p>
<h2>Downloading the SDK</h2>
<p>Before you set up a local package feed, download the SDK as a zip archive from <code>https://aurora.imint.se/download/<b>yourlicensekey</b>/vidview-latest.zip</code>. Once downloaded, unzip its contents somewhere on disk, e.g. <code>C:\Vidview SDK\</code>. When updates are available, use the same link to download an archive containing the new version.
    
<h2>Configuring NuGet package manager</h2>
<h3>Opening the NuGet settings dialog</h3>
<ol>
	<li>In the "Solution Explorer", right click on your newly created Windows Forms project, and select "Manage NuGet Packages...".</li>
	<li>In the Manage NuGet Packages dialog, click "Settings".</li>
</ol>

<h3>Adding the package source</h3>
<p>Under Package Manager/Package Sources, click the <code>+</code> button to add a new Package Source. Select it in the list and enter the Name <code>vidview-dev</code> and Source <code style="white-space: nowrap">C:\Vidview&nbsp;SDK\</code>. Click Update, then OK.</p>

<h3>Enabling listing of prerelease packages</h3>
<p>At the top of the Manage Nuget Packages dialog, there is a drop-down menu with two possible settings: <ul><li><code>Stable Only</code></li> and <li><code>Include Prerelease</code>.</li></ul> In order to list all of the available packages in the SDK, make sure to select to <code>Include Prerelease</code> packages (as shown in Figure 5).

<h3>Installing packages</h3>
<p>The packages from vidview-dev should now be listed in the Manage Nuget Packages window. It might take a few seconds, but upon completion it should look like below.</p>
<p>You should now install the packages <code>Imint.Vidview.Sample.Gui</code> and <code>Imint.Vidview.Sample.UserControl</code>. The easiest way to locate these packages is by typing <code>sample</code> in the search field on the top right. Once located, click "Install".</p>

<p>The <code>Imint.Vidview.Sample.Gui</code> and <code>Imint.Vidview.Sample.UserControl</code> packages will automatically install all of their dependencies. This might take a minute, so be patient.</p>

<p>Before closing the Nuget Package Manager window, note "Updates" in the menu to the right. When updates to the Vidview SDK are available, this is where you go to install them. For more information, see the section about <a href="#installing.packages_updating.packages">updating packages</a> below. </p> 
<p>After installing the packages, build the project, by selecting "Build Solution" from the "Build" menu, or by pressing F7. When ready, the output window should indicate a successful build.</p>
