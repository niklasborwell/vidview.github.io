<header>Vidview SDK Demo Application Installation Guide</header>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This document will guide you through downloading and installing the Vidview SDK Demo application. This demo application is the same fully featured application that you can build yourself by following the <a href="Vidview .NET SDK Getting Started Guide.html">Vidview .NET SDK Getting Started Guide</a>, and is intended to showcase the capabilities of the Vidview SDK and Vidhance. As such, it is not a commercial end user product.</p>
<p>Should you run into problems during the installation problems or have questions or concerns, please contact us at support@imint.se or see our <a href="http://imint.se/about">About</a> page for additional contact information.

<h1>Downloading the installer</h1>
<p>First, download the <a href="vidview.imint.se/installation/Imint.Installer.exe">installer</a> (right-click and Save Link As). Your browser may issue a warning about the file, flagging it as being an "unusual" download or similar, in which case you may have to actively confirm the download before your browser starts downloading it.</p>

<h1>Running the installer</h1>
<p>Once downloaded, run Imint.Installer.exe. Your anti-virus software and / or firewall software may question the integrity of the installer, which will require internet access. The installer will ask you for your license key.

Once entered, hit the "next" button to continue. Assuming you are connected to the internet, and you entered a valid license key, you should now see a list of components to install.

Once you have made your selection, hit the "next" button to continue. The installer will now acquire the necessary components and install the Vidview SDK Demo application. Once finished, close the installer and launch the Vidview SDK Demo application, either from the (optional) start menu shortcut or by launching <code>Imint.Vidview.Window.exe</code> located in <code>C:\Programs&nbsp;(x86)\Vidview</code>.
