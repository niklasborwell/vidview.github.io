<header>Example of automatic sharp stills selector</header>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This shows the Imint roadmap feature of automatically select the sharpest video frame to use as snapshot. Imint Vidhance meta analysis already provide
information on video frame sharpness, which would be utilized in this function. On a moving platform, some video frames will be sharper than others, due to vibrations.
The feature will work like this: when an operator clicks to select a snapshot from moving video, the function will search in a narrow band of previous and future frames
, selecting as a snapshot the one with best visibility. Increasing the band will provide better sharpness, while a more narrow search band will ensure timing accuracy.
</p>




<h2>Example</h2>
 <p>Below are five consecutive frames from an aerial video from a helicopter platform. In this example the search band is set to 2, which means that the current frame and +/- two
 frames will be analysed, in total 5 frames.
  </p>

<ol>
	<li>Frame n-2</li>
		<img src="images/frame1.png" width="480" height="270">
	<li>Frame n-1</li>
		<img src="images/frame2.png" width="480" height="270">
	<li>Frame n</li>
		<img src="images/frame3.png" width="480" height="270">
	<li>Frame n+1</li>
		<img src="images/frame4.png" width="480" height="270">
	<li>Frame n+2</li>
		<img src="images/frame5.png" width="480" height="270">

		</ol>
</p>


<p> In this example, the frame n+1 would be automatically selected to be used as snapshot still image. </p>
